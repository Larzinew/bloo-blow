# Bl-OO Project Readme
## Introduction
Welcome to my project! The Bloo Bar Appointment Scheduler is a user-friendly web application designed to streamline and enhance the customer experience at Bloo Bar, a specialized salon focusing on creating stunning and lasting blowouts. The scheduler offers convenient online booking for a variety of services, including wash and style, updos, braiding, curling, straightening, and more. Users can easily navigate through available services, book appointments, and manage their schedules. The application aims to provide a seamless and efficient way for clients to schedule their blowouts while showcasing the expertise and dedication of Bloo Bar's skilled stylists.
