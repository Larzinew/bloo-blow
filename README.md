## Introduction
Welcome to my project! The Bloo Bar Appointment Scheduler is a user-friendly web application designed to streamline and enhance the customer experience at Bloo Bar, a specialized salon focusing on creating stunning and lasting blowouts. The application aims to provide a seamless and efficient way for clients to schedule their blowouts while showcasing the expertise and dedication of Bloo Bar's skilled stylists.

**Here's a sneak peek with some screenshots:**

The scheduler offers convenient online booking for a variety of services, including wash and style, updos, braiding, curling, straightening, and more.
